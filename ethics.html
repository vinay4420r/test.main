  <h1 class="term-title">Publication Ethics And Publication <br>Malpractice Statement</h1>
  
  <p class="term-para">

      At IJEMSS, we are committed to upholding the highest standards of publication ethics and actively combatting any form of publication malpractice. Our guidelines align with the COPE Principles of Transparency and Best Practice Guidelines as well as the COPE Code of Conduct. For further details, please visit: COPE Website.
<br><br>
      Publication ethics are crucial for enhancing the quality of research globally. In this section, we outline the standards expected of editors, authors, and reviewers. It is important to note that the publisher does not interfere with the integrity of the content but focuses solely on facilitating timely publication.</p>
<h1 class="term-title">EDITORIAL RESPONSIBILITIES</h1>

<p class="term-para">

 1- Decisions made by the Editors regarding the acceptance or rejection of a manuscript should be grounded in the manuscript's significance, novelty, clarity, and relevance. Editors are expected to handle submissions in a timely fashion.<br>

 2- It is the Editors' responsibility to select suitable reviewers who possess the relevant expertise to assess the manuscript critically and are free from any conflicts of interest. Reviewers should be impartial in their evaluations.<br>
  
 3- Manuscripts under review must be treated as confidential. They should not be disclosed or discussed with anyone outside the review process without the editor's explicit authorization.<br>
  
 4- The Editor is accountable for determining which articles are published in the journal.<br>
  
 5- The Editor's decisions may be influenced by the journal's editorial board policies and must comply with legal requirements, including issues related to copyright and plagiarism.<br>
  
 6- Editors must ensure they have no conflicts of interest regarding the manuscript, including any potential conflicts related to the research, authors, or funding sources.<br>
  
 7- The identities of reviewers must remain confidential and should not be disclosed before or after the publication of the manuscript.</p>

 <h1 class="term-title">DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF REVIEWERS</h1>

<p class="term-para">

 1- Peer review supports the editor in making editorial decisions and, through communication with the author, can aid in enhancing the quality of the manuscript.<br>

 2- Peer review is a fundamental aspect of scholarly communication. Authors seeking to publish are expected to contribute fairly to the review process.<br>
  
 3- Reviewers should address ethical concerns and potential issues of research or publication misconduct.<br>
  
 4- Reviewers are expected to complete their evaluations in a timely manner and must inform the editor if they are unable to do so.<br>
  
 5- Manuscript confidentiality must be maintained by reviewers.<br>
  
 6- Information or ideas acquired during the peer review process must remain confidential and not be used for personal gain.<br>
  
 7- Reviews should be conducted impartially. Personal criticisms of the author are not acceptable. Reviewers should present their opinions with clear, well-supported arguments.<br>
  
 8- Reviewers should point out any relevant published work that the authors have not cited. Any claims based on previous research should be properly referenced.<br>
  
 9- Reviewers should inform the editor of any significant similarities or overlaps between the manuscript and other published works with which they are familiar.<br>
  
10- If a reviewer feels they are not qualified to assess the manuscript or if timely review is not feasible, they should notify the editor and withdraw from the review process.<br>
</p>
<h1 class="term-title">AUTHORS RESPONSIBILITIES</h1>

<p class="term-para">

 1- Research reported in IJEMSS must be conducted with ethical integrity and adhere to all applicable legal requirements.<br>

 2- Researchers are required to present their findings with clarity and honesty, ensuring no fabrication, falsification, or inappropriate manipulation of data occurs.<br>

  
3-  The corresponding author must verify that all co-authors are appropriately listed, that no unauthorized individuals are included, and that all co-authors have reviewed and approved the final manuscript for submission.<br>
  
 4- Authorship should be confined to individuals who have made substantial contributions to the conception, design, execution, or interpretation of the research.<br>
  
 5- All individuals who have made notable contributions should be acknowledged as co-authors.<br>
  
 6- Authors must avoid plagiarism and self-plagiarism.<br>
  
 7- Authors are expected to agree with the open access policy, allowing unrestricted access and reuse of published articles.<br>
  
8-   Manuscripts must include sufficient detail and references to enable replication of the work. Any fraudulent or deliberately inaccurate statements are considered unethical and unacceptable.<br>
  
9-   Authors may be requested to provide raw data for editorial review and should be prepared to make this data publicly accessible if feasible. They must also retain the data for a reasonable period following publication, and are responsible for ensuring data reproducibility.<br>
  
10-  Authors must ensure their work is original and, if they have utilized the work or words of others, these sources must be properly cited or quoted.<br>
  
11-   An author should not submit manuscripts detailing essentially the same research to multiple journals or primary publications. Submitting a manuscript to more than one journal simultaneously is considered unethical and unacceptable. Likewise, submitting a previously published paper to another journal is prohibited.<br>
  
12-  If an author identifies a significant error or inaccuracy in their published work, they are obligated to promptly inform the journal editor or publisher and collaborate on a retraction or correction. If a third party identifies an error, the author must promptly address it or provide evidence supporting the accuracy of the original publication.<br><br>
  
  Editors and reviewers are committed to ensuring that articles submitted to IJEMSS are original and not under consideration elsewhere. Manuscripts will be reviewed fairly and objectively, and authors will receive feedback and suggestions in a timely manner based on reviewer availability and expertise.
</p>
<h1 class="term-title">DEALING WITH POTENTIAL MISCONDUCT</h1>

<p class="term-para">
Editors have a responsibility to act when they suspect misconduct or receive allegations of misconduct, whether these pertain to unpublished or published articles. It is not enough to simply reject papers that raise concerns; editors are ethically required to actively pursue and address these allegations. Initially, editors should seek a response from the individuals accused of misconduct. If the response is unsatisfactory, editors must involve the relevant institutions or other appropriate bodies to conduct a thorough investigation. Editors are expected to make every reasonable effort to ensure a proper investigation is carried out. If such an investigation does not occur, they should persist in seeking a resolution to the issue.
</p>
<h1 class="term-title">PLAGIARISM</h1>

<p class="term-para">
  When authors submit manuscripts to IJEMSS, they affirm that their work is free from plagiarism. While the Editor undertakes reasonable measures to verify the academic integrity of the submitted papers, the ultimate responsibility for ensuring the originality of manuscripts rests with the authors.

  Plagiarism occurs when an author intentionally uses another’s work without proper permission, credit, or acknowledgment. It is crucial for authors to give due credit to the contributions of others, including those of their advisors or their own prior research. Authors should frame their work within the broader context of their field’s development and duly recognize the contributions of others that have influenced their research.
  
  </p>
  <h1 class="term-title">ETHICAL OVERSIGHT</h1>

<p class="term-para">
  If the research involves chemicals, human participants, animals, procedures, or equipment with inherent unusual hazards, authors must clearly identify these in their manuscript to comply with ethical standards for research involving animals and human subjects. Additionally, if necessary, authors should provide appropriate legal or ethical clearance from relevant associations or organizations. For research involving confidential data or proprietary business and marketing practices, authors must explicitly state how the data or information will be securely protected.
  </p>

 8-   Manuscripts must include sufficient detail and references to enable replication of the work. Any fraudulent or deliberately inaccurate statements are considered unethical and unacceptable.<br>
    
 9-   Authors may be requested to provide raw data for editorial review and should be prepared to make this data publicly accessible if feasible. They must also retain the data for a reasonable period following publication, and are responsible for ensuring data reproducibility.<br>
    
  10-  Authors must ensure their work is original and, if they have utilized the work or words of others, these sources must be properly cited or quoted.<br>
    
 11-   An author should not submit manuscripts detailing essentially the same research to multiple journals or primary publications. Submitting a manuscript to more than one journal simultaneously is considered unethical and unacceptable. Likewise, submitting a previously published paper to another journal is prohibited.<br>
    
  12-  If an author identifies a significant error or inaccuracy in their published work, they are obligated to promptly inform the journal editor or publisher and collaborate on a retraction or correction. If a third party identifies an error, the author must promptly address it or provide evidence supporting the accuracy of the original publication.<br><br>
    
    Editors and reviewers are committed to ensuring that articles submitted to IJEMSS are original and not under consideration elsewhere. Manuscripts will be reviewed fairly and objectively, and authors will receive feedback and suggestions in a timely manner based on reviewer availability and expertise.

<h1 class="term-title">DEALING WITH POTENTIAL MISCONDUCT</h1>
  
<p class="term-para">
 Editors have a responsibility to act when they suspect misconduct or receive allegations of misconduct, whether these pertain to unpublished or published articles. It is not enough to simply reject papers that raise concerns; editors are ethically required to actively pursue and address these allegations. Initially, editors should seek a response from the individuals accused of misconduct. If the response is unsatisfactory, editors must involve the relevant institutions or other appropriate bodies to conduct a thorough investigation. Editors are expected to make every reasonable effort to ensure a proper investigation is carried out. If such an investigation does not occur, they should persist in seeking a resolution to the issue.
</p>
<h1 class="term-title">PLAGIARISM</h1>
  
<p class="term-para">
    When authors submit manuscripts to IJEMSS, they affirm that their work is free from plagiarism. While the Editor undertakes reasonable measures to verify the academic integrity of the submitted papers, the ultimate responsibility for ensuring the originality of manuscripts rests with the authors.

    Plagiarism occurs when an author intentionally uses another’s work without proper permission, credit, or acknowledgment. It is crucial for authors to give due credit to the contributions of others, including those of their advisors or their own prior research. Authors should frame their work within the broader context of their field’s development and duly recognize the contributions of others that have influenced their research.
    
    </p>
    <h1 class="term-title">ETHICAL OVERSIGHT</h1>
  
<p class="term-para">
    If the research involves chemicals, human participants, animals, procedures, or equipment with inherent unusual hazards, authors must clearly identify these in their manuscript to comply with ethical standards for research involving animals and human subjects. Additionally, if necessary, authors should provide appropriate legal or ethical clearance from relevant associations or organizations. For research involving confidential data or proprietary business and marketing practices, authors must explicitly state how the data or information will be securely protected.
