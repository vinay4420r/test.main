    <p class="term-para">
        1- The corresponding author must submit their manuscript through the journal’s online submission system at <br>

        2- Upon submission, a paper ID will be assigned and sent to the author.<br>
        
        3- The author will receive email instructions for the subsequent steps and can monitor the manuscript’s progress using the provided paper ID.</p>
<h1 class="term-title2">EDITORIAL BOARD</h1>
<p class="term-para">
    1- The Editorial Board will verify that the manuscript adheres to the Guide for Authors in terms of plagiarism, formatting, and composition, ensuring it includes all required sections and follows the prescribed style. Manuscripts that do not meet these criteria will be returned to the authors for revisions.<br>

   2- The Editor-in-Chief will assess whether the submitted manuscript aligns with the focus and scope of IJEMSS. Manuscripts that do not meet these fundamental requirements will be rejected without further review.<br>
    
   3- If the manuscript meets all necessary criteria, the Editor-in-Chief will assign it to a Reviewer with relevant expertise, who will oversee the peer review process. Reviewers have the authority to reject manuscripts they consider unlikely to pass peer review.<br>
    
  4-  Submitted articles undergo a double-blind peer review process.<br>
    
  5-  Articles deemed suitable by the Editor will be reviewed by two independent experts in the relevant field. These reviewers will not know each other’s identities.<br>
    
   6- Reviewers will evaluate various aspects of the manuscript, provide specific suggestions for improvement, and make a recommendation regarding its suitability for publication.<br>
    
  7-  The review will be submitted to the journal with a recommendation to accept or reject the paper, or request revisions (major or minor), which must be thoroughly substantiated and justified.</p>

  <h1 class="term-title2">The key parameters to be applied in the final evaluation of all types of submissions are</h1>
  <p class="term-para">
   1- Originality (Does the manuscript present novel evidence or ideas that advance understanding in the relevant socio-economic context?)<br>

 2-   Excellence (Includes aspects such as clarity, coherence, use of English language and grammar, depth of analysis, and overall presentation.)<br>
    
 3-   Significance (Pertains to the manuscript's appeal to readers, generalizability, relevance, the importance of the subject matter, and its potential impact on societal, economic, or scientific domains.)
    
    </p>
    <h1 class="term-title2">Four possible decisions may therefore be reached</h1>
    <p class="term-para">
      1-  Accept: The manuscript meets all publication criteria and is deemed suitable for publication.<br>

     2-   Minor/Major Revisions Required: The manuscript requires additional revisions to meet all publication standards.<br>
        
      3-  Reject with Invitation to Resubmit: The manuscript does not meet crucial criteria, and substantial revisions are necessary for potential resubmission.<br>
        
       4- Reject: The manuscript does not meet essential criteria, and it is improbable that further revisions will address the fundamental issues.
     </p>
     <h1 class="term-title2">CONFIRMATION OF THE DECISION AND COMMUNICATION TO THE AUTHORS</h1>
     <p class="term-para">
        All decisions are finalized by the Editor-in-Chief before any notifications are sent. The Editorial Board will email the corresponding author with the decision, including any pertinent reviewer comments. Comments and related documents will be provided in an anonymized format.

      <br>  Revision Stage: Manuscripts recommended for revision will be returned to the submitting author.
        
      <br>  Final Steps: Upon acceptance, IJEMSS ensures that articles are published swiftly and accurately. The corresponding author will receive an acceptance email and must submit the Copyright form. Once the required documents are received, the article will be published online under the Creative Commons Attribution – Non Commercial – No Derivatives Alike (CC-BY-NC-ND) license within 4 hours. Copyright for commercial and associated uses remains with the Publisher.
        
     <br>   After the completion of all necessary steps by the author, the paper/article will be published online in the respective volume/issue. The author will also receive a certificate of publication via email.
         
       </p>
       <h1 class="term-title2">FAIR PLAY</h1>
       <p class="term-para">
        Editors should assess manuscripts solely based on their intellectual merit, independent of the authors' race, gender, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, ethnic background, citizenship, or political views. The decision to accept or reject a manuscript for publication should be grounded exclusively in its significance, originality, clarity, and the study's relevance to the journal's objectives.
         </p>
         <h1 class="term-title2">COPYRIGHT POLICY</h1>
         <p class="term-para">
            Copyright policies are formal documents that define the rights associated with the use and distribution of an original work. Upon submitting a paper, authors are required to agree to a copyright arrangement aligned with an open access (CC-BY NC-ND) license. This license allows authors to retain the copyright for their articles. It also grants users the freedom to reuse, download, print, extract, archive, and distribute the article, provided proper credit is given to the authors and the source of the work is acknowledged. This arrangement maximizes the availability of the paper and allows it to be included in any IRJMETS archive. </p>
            <h1 class="term-title2">List of author rights in copyright policy:</h1>
            <p class="term-para">
For subsequent research, it is permissible to reuse ideas or data from this paper. Reproduction of the article for academic, instructional, or teaching purposes is also allowed. The published version of the article may be utilized in presentations such as conferences and seminars. Additionally, permission may be granted for others to use or reuse tables or figures from the article. </p>
<h1 class="term-title2">List of all rights author(s) are granting to IJEMSS:</h1>
<p class="term-para">
    Grant the rights to reproduce, publish, distribute, edit, and translate the work (whether exclusively or non-exclusively). Allow for adaptations and the creation of derivative works based on the original. Ensure the article's availability in all formats and media, including any future technologies. Assert the right to enforce copyright on behalf of the author. Clearly outline the rights expected from the author(s) to prevent any potential misunderstandings, similar to the author rights section. </p>
    <h1 class="term-title2">AUTHOR WARRANTIES AND DEFINITIONS</h1>
    <p class="term-para">
       1- Originality: The submission must be the author's original work.<br>
2- Publication Status: The work has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by any other journal.<br>
3- Citations: All material and information sourced from third parties must be properly cited in the manuscript.<br>
4- Permission: Authors must have obtained permission for any material used from other sources.<br>
5- Plagiarism: The study must be original and free from plagiarized content. Authors will be held accountable if they merely rewrite existing content or alter the title of previously published papers.
